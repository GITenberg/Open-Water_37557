A FOREWORD
</H3>

<P>
To even the casual reader of poetry who may chance to turn to the
following pages it will be evident that the lyrics contained therein
have been written without what is commonly known as end-rhyme.  It may
also be claimed by this reader that the lyrics before him are without
rhythm.  As such, it may at first seem that they mark an effort in
revolt against two of the primary assets of modern versification.
</P>

<P>
All art, of course, has its ancestry.  While it is the duty of poetry
both to remember and to honour its inherited grandeurs, the paradoxical
fact remains that even this most convention-ridden medium of emotional
expression is a sort of warfare between the embattled soul of the
artist, seeking articulation, and the immuring traditions with which
time and the prosodian have surrounded him.
</P>

<P>
In painting and in music, as in sculpture and the drama, there has been
a movement of late to achieve what may be called formal emancipation, a
struggle to break away from the restraints and the technical
obligations imposed upon the worker by his artistic predecessors.  In
one case this movement may be called Futurism, and in another it may be
termed Romanticism, but the tendency is the same.  The spirit of man is
seen in rebellion against a form that has become too intricate or too
fixed to allow him freedom of utterance.
</P>

<P>
Poetry alone, during the last century, seems to have remained stable,
in the matter of structure.  Few new forms have been invented, and with
one or two rare exceptions success has been achieved through
ingeniously elaborating on an already established formula and through
meticulously re-echoing what has already been said.  This has resulted,
on the one hand, in a technical dexterity which often enough resembles
the strained postures of acrobatism, and, on the other, in that
constantly reiterated complaint as to the hollowness and aloofness of
modern poetry.  Yet this poetry is remote and insincere, not because
the modern spirit is incapable of feeling, but because what the singer
of to-day has felt has not been directly and openly expressed.  His
apparel has remained mediæval.  He must still don mail to face Mausers,
and wear chain-armour against machine-guns.  He must scout through the
shadowy hinterlands of consciousness in attire that may be historic,
yet at the same time is distressingly conspicuous.  And when he begins
his assault on those favouring moments or inspirational moods which
lurk in the deeper valleys and by-ways of sensibility, he must begin it
as a marked man, pathetically resplendent in that rigid steel which is
an anachronism and no longer an armour.
</P>

<P>
Rhyme, from the first, has been imposed upon him.  His only escape from
rhyme has been the larger utterance of blank verse.  Yet the iambic
pentameter of his native tongue, perfected in the sweeping sonority of
the later Shakespearean tragedies and left even more intimidatingly
austere in the organ-like roll of Milton, has been found by the later
singer to be ill-fitted for the utterance of those more intimate moods
and those subjective experiences which may be described as
characteristically modern.  Verse, in the nature of things, has become
less epic and racial, and more and more lyric and personal.  The poet,
consequently, has been forced back into the narrower domain so formally
and so rigidly fenced in by rhyme.  And before touching on the
limitations resulting from this incarceration, it may be worth while to
venture a brief glance back over the history of what Milton himself
denominated as "the jingling sounds of like endings" and Goldsmith
characterized as "a vile monotony" and even Howells has spoken of as
"the artificial trammels of verse."
</P>

<P>
It has been claimed that those early poets of Palestine who affected
the custom of beginning a number of lines or stanzas with the same
letter of the alphabet unconsciously prepared the way for that
latter-day ornamental fringe known as end-rhyme.  Others have claimed
that this insistence of a consonance of terminals is a relique of the
communal force of the chant, where the clapping of hands, the stamping
of feet, or the twanging of bow-strings marked the period-ends of
prehistoric recitative.  The bow-string of course, later evolved into
the musical instrument, and when poetry became a written as well as a
spoken language the consonantal drone of rhyming end-words took the
place of the discarded instrument which had served to mark a secondary
and wider rhythm in the progress of impassioned recitative.
</P>

<P>
It must be admitted, however, even in the face of this ingenious
pleading, that rhyme is a much more modern invention than it seems.
That it is not rudimentary in the race is evidenced by the fact that
many languages, such as the Celtic, the Teutonic, and the Scandinavian,
are quite without it.  The Greeks, even in their melic poetry, saw no
need for it.  The same may be said of the Romans, though with them it
will occasionally be found that the semi-feet of the pentameter
constitute what may be called accidental rhyme.  Rhyming Latin verse,
indeed, does not come into existence until the end of the fourth
century, and it is not until the time of the Conquest that end-rhyme
becomes in any way general in English song.  Layman, in translating
Wace's <I>Le Brut d'Angleterre</I>, found the original work written in
rhymed lines, and in following that early model produced what is
probably the first rhymed poem written in England.
</P>

<P>
With the introduction of end-rhymes came the discovery that a
decoration so formal could convert verse into something approaching the
architectural.  It gave design to the lyric.  With this new
definiteness of outline, of course, came a newer rigidity of medium.
Form was acknowledged as the visible presentation of this particular
art.  Formal variations became a matter of studious attention.  Efforts
were made to leave language in itself instrumental, and in these
efforts sound frequently comes perilously near triumphing over sense.
The exotic formal growths of other languages were imported into
England.  No verbal <I>tour de force</I> of <I>troubadour</I> or <I>trouvère</I> or
<I>jongleur</I> or Ronsardist was too fantastic for imitation and adoption.
The one-time primitive directness of English was overrun by such forms
as the ballade, the chant royal, the rondel, the kyrielle, the rondeau
and the rondeau redoublé, the virelai and the pantoum, the sestina, the
villanelle, and last, yet by no means least, the sonnet.  But through
the immense tangle of our intricate lyric growths it can now be seen
that mere mechanics do not always make poetry.  While rhyme has,
indeed, served its limited purposes, it must be remembered that the
highest English verse has been written without rhyme.  This verbal
embroidery, while it presents to the workman in words a pleasingly
decorative form, at the same time imposes on him both an adventitious
restraint and an increased self-consciousness.  The twentieth century
poet, singing with his scrupulously polished vocalisation, usually
finds himself content to re-echo what has been said before.  He is
unable to "travel light"; pioneering with so heavy a burden is out of
the question.  Rhyme and meter have compelled him to sacrifice content
for form.  It has left him incapable of what may be called abandonment.
And the consciousness of his technical impedimenta has limited the
roads along which he may adventure.  His preoccupation with formal
exactions has implanted in him an instinctive abhorrence for anything
beyond the control of what he calls common-sense.  Dominated by this
emotional and intellectual timidity, he has attributed to end-rhyme and
accentual rhythm the self-sufficiency of mystic rites, in the face of
the fact that the fewer the obstacles between feeling and expression
the richer the literary product must be, and forgetting, too, that
poetry represents the extreme vanguard of consciousness both
adventuring and pioneering along the path of future progress.
</P>

<P>
For the poet to turn his back on rhythm, as at times he has been able
to do with rhyme, is an impossibility.  For the rhythmising instinct is
innate and persistent in man, standing for a law which permeates every
manifestation of energy.  The great heart of Nature itself beats with a
regular systole and diastole.  But, rhythmically, the modern versifier
has been a Cubist without quite comprehending it.  He has been viewing
the world mathematically.  He has been crowding his soul into a
geometrically designed mould.  He has bowed to a rule-of-thumb order of
speech, arbitrarily imposed on him by an ancestry which wrung its
ingenuous pleasure out of an ingenuous regularity of stress and accent.
To succeed under that law he must practise an adroit form of
self-deception, solemnly pretending to fit his lines to a mould which
he actually over-runs and occasionally ignores.  He has not been
satisfied with the rhythm of Nature, whose heart-beats in their
manifold expressions are omnipresent but never confined to any single
sustained pulse or any one limited movement.  It is not argued that he
should ignore rhythm altogether.  To do so, as has already been said,
would be impossible, since life itself is sustained by the rise and
fall of mortal breasts and the beat and throb of mortal hearts.  Rhythm
is in man's blood.  The ear of the world instinctively searches for
cadences.  The poet's efforts towards symphonic phrasing have long
since become habitual and imperative.  But that he should confine
himself to certain man-made laws of meter, that he should be shackled
by the prosodian of the past, is quite another matter.  His
predecessors have fashioned many rhythms that are pretty, many
accentual forms that are cunningly intricate, but at a time when his
manner of singing has lost its vital swing it is well for man to forget
these formal prettinesses and equally well to remember that poetry is
not an intellectual exercise but the immortal soul of perplexed
mortality seeking expression.
</P>

<P>
To abandon fixed rhythm, or meter, for the floating rhythm of the chant
may not be an immediate solution of the problem.  To follow the Psalms
of David, for example, will not suddenly conjure a new school of verse
into the world.  But to return to the more open movement of the chant,
which is man's natural and rudimentary form of song, may constitute a
step towards freedom.  The mere effort towards emancipation, in fact,
is not without its value.  It may serve to impress on certain minds the
fact that poetry is capable of exhausting one particular form of
expression, of incorporating and consuming one particular embodiment of
perishable matter and passing on to its newer fields.  Being a living
organism, it uses up what lies before it, and to find new vigour must
forever feed on new forms.  Being the product of man's spirit, which is
forever subject to change, verse must not be worshipped for what it has
been, but for what it is capable of being.  No necrophilic regard for
its established conventions must blind the lover of beautiful verse to
the fact that the primary function of poetry is both to intellectualize
sensation and to elucidate emotional experience.  If man must worship
beauty only as he has known it in the past, man must be satisfied with
worshipping that which has lived and now is dead.

I watched the men at work on the stubborn rock,<BR>
But mostly the one man poised on a drill<BR>
Above the steam that hissed and billowed about him<BR>
White in the frosty air,<BR>
Where the lordly house would stand.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Majestic, muscular, high like a god,<BR>
He stood,<BR>
And controlled and stopped<BR>

Offhand and careless and lordly as Thor,<BR>
Begrimed and solemn and crowned with sweat,<BR>
Where the great steel chains swung over the buckets of rock.<BR>

Then out of a nearby house came a youth,<BR>
All gloved and encased in fur and touched with content,<BR>
Thin-shouldered and frail and finished,<BR>
Leading a house-dog out on a silver chain.<BR>
He peered at the figure that fought with the drill<BR>
Above the billowing steam and tumult of sound,<BR>
Peered up for a moment impassive,<BR>
With almost pitying eyes,<BR>
And then went pensively down the Avenue's calm,<BR>
In the clear white light of the noonday sun,<BR>
Not holding, but held by his silvery chain!<BR>

Silent between the hills,<BR>
Empty of moon-lit marketplace,<BR>

The beat of the drums awakes!<BR>
Then loud through the little streets,<BR>
And strange to the startled roofs,<BR>

All swart and grim they go,<BR>
The battalions of regret,<BR>
After the drums, the valiant drums<BR>

The city is old in sin,<BR>
And children are not for cities,<BR>
And, wan-eyed woman, you want them not,<BR>
You say with a broken laugh.<BR>
Yet out of each wayward softness of voice,<BR>
And each fulness of breast,<BR>
And each flute-throated echo of song,<BR>
Each flutter of lace and quest of beautiful things,<BR>
Each coil of entangling hair built into its crown,<BR>
Each whisper and touch in the silence of night,<BR>
Each red unreasoning mouth that is lifted to mouth,<BR>
Each whiteness of brow that is furrowed no more with thought,<BR>
Each careless soft curve of lips that can never explain,<BR>
Arises the old and the inappeasable cry!<BR>
Every girl who leans from a tenement sill<BR>
And flutters a hand to a youth,<BR>
Every woman who waits for a man in the dusk,<BR>
Every harlotous arm flung up to a drunken heel<BR>
That would trample truth down in the dust,<BR>
Reaches unknowingly out for its own,<BR>
And blind to its heritage waits<BR>
For its child!<BR>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
